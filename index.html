            <h2>What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?</h2>
            <p>
                Imagine teaching a computer to think and learn, a bit like humans do. That's the basic idea behind
                <span class="highlight">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                AI is about creating smart machines or computer programs that can do tasks that usually require human intelligence.
                These tasks include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning from experience (like how you learn not to touch a hot stove).</li>
                <li>Understanding spoken or written language (like talking to Siri or Alexa).</li>
                <li>Recognizing things in pictures (like how Facebook can suggest tags for photos).</li>
                <li>Making decisions and solving problems.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                AI isn't about robots taking over the world like in movies! It's mostly about software that helps us in many ways,
                from simple apps on your phone to complex systems that predict the weather.

        <section id="why-python" class="section">
            <h2>Why is Python Used for AI?</h2>
            <p>
                <span class="highlight">Python</span> is a popular programming language, and it's a favorite for building AI applications.
                Here’s why:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Easy to Read and Write:</strong> Python's code looks a bit like plain English. This makes it easier for
                    beginners to learn and for teams to work together.
                    For example, to print "Hello AI" you just write: <code class="code-like">print("Hello AI")</code>. Simple!
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Lots of Helpful Tools:</strong> Python has many pre-built tools (called libraries) specifically for AI.
                    These tools save a lot of time because developers don't have to build everything from scratch.
                    Think of them like having a full toolbox instead of just a hammer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Big Community:</strong> Many people use Python. This means if you get stuck, it's easy to find help,
                    tutorials, and examples online.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Works Everywhere:</strong> Python programs can run on many different types of computers (Windows, Mac, Linux)
                    without needing big changes.
                </li>

            <h2>Simple Examples of AI in Daily Life</h2>
            <p>You probably use AI every day without even realizing it! Here are a few examples:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Spam Filters:</strong> Your email uses AI to guess which emails are junk (spam) and which are important.
                    It learns over time what spam looks like.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Recommendation Systems:</strong> When Netflix suggests movies or Amazon recommends products, that's AI at work.
                    It looks at what you've liked before and suggests similar things.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Voice Assistants:</strong> Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant use AI to understand your voice commands and
                    find answers for you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Smart Photo Apps:</strong> When Google Photos groups pictures of the same person or lets you search for
                    "dogs," it's using AI to "see" and understand images.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Navigation Apps:</strong> Apps like Google Maps or Waze use AI to find the fastest routes and predict traffic.
                </li>
            </ul>
